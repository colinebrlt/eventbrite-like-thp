## EVENTBRITE
This website was made in pair-programming as part of a coding bootcamp.

# Description
This is an Eventbrite-like website made with Ruby on Rails, and the 'Devise' gem. 
Its main functionalities are :

- Creating a user account (sign in, log in, log out)
- Creating an event
- Subscribing to an event
- Sending email when a user creates an account and subscribes to an event

# How to make it work
In your terminal, run the following commands:

```shell
$ bundle install
```

```shell
$ rails db:migrate
```

```shell
$ rails server
```

Alternatively, the website has also been pushed on Heroku: https://eventbrite-rails-cbrlt.herokuapp.com
